# Pay-Roll-Tracker
I have created an employee and employee salary tracker

- When "add an employee" button is clicked, the user is presented with prompts asking for First Name, Last Name and Salary
- When employees are finished being added, the user will receive a prompt to add more or cancel
- When the user chooses to continue, the user can continue to add more employees
- When the user chooses to cancel, the user will be displayed the data in alphatebetical order by last name
AND, the console log will show aggregated data, AND, a random employee's details
- including: First Name, Last Name and Salary

I utilised some foundational javascript concepts including
- for and while loops, to determine outcomes
- if statements 
- mathematical formulas such as +=, 
- let and const variables
- arrays, booleans, numbers and string
- I also included console logs to display information
- Interpolation was used to create string outputs from generated data
- prompts and alerts if inputted data is incorrect or missing
- I also refered to the existing code to create new variables
- Used criteria concepts such as isNan, return, Math and if statements
